# ftail
ftail is a command-line utility for concurrently monitoring and tailing multiple log files. It is designed to be a more flexible alternative to tail \-F, especially for environments where log files are rotated, created, or deleted frequently. The tool supports glob patterns, automatically detects new files, and handles symbolic links.
